\title{Input and validate human and computer players}
\usage{
input_players(players_db)
}
\arguments{
\item{players_db}{Player Database in Local Directory}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
  \describe{
    \item{session_players}{A named list of players (human and computer) with their info for the current session.}
    \item{players_db}{The updated player database (named list).}
  }
}
\description{
Allows input of human player names, creates computer players,
             loads or creates player data with coins.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Typical usage: prompt for human and computer player setup.
result <- input_players(players_db = list())
str(result$session_players)

# Example: Simulate a session with existing player data
# Suppose previous game left Alice with 800 coins, Computer_1 with 500 coins
players_db <- list(
  Alice = list(name = "Alice", coins = 800, is_computer = FALSE),
  Computer_1 = list(name = "Computer_1", coins = 500, is_computer = TRUE)
)
# Start a new session; try to continue as Alice, add another human, add one more computer player
result2 <- input_players(players_db)

# After running, you can check who joined this session and their starting balances:
lapply(result2$session_players, function(x) x$coins)

# Edge case: Old player with zero coins (bankrupt) tries to rejoin
players_db3 <- list(
  Bob = list(name = "Bob", coins = 0, is_computer = FALSE)
)
result3 <- input_players(players_db3)
# Will be prompted to create a new profile or skip

# The function always returns a list:
# - $session_players: all current session players (named list)
# - $players_db: the full player database (including new/old players)
}
}

## 🎲 Interactive Gameplay

### 🚀 Start Playing

```{r eval = FALSE}
play()
```

To begin a game, simply run:

You’ll be prompted to:

-   Choose human or computer player

-   Enter player names

-   Place your bet

-   Make moves (hit, stand, split, etc.)

### 💸 Betting and Coins

Each player starts with a coin balance. You bet each round. Outcomes impact your balance:

-   Blackjack: **1.5× payout**

-   Win: **1× payout**

-   Push: **bet returned**

-   Loss: **bet lost**

-   5-card Charlie: **auto win**

-   Your coin balance is saved between sessions under your player name.

### 🤖 Computer Players

AI players follow simple strategy:

-   Bet 10 coins or remaining balance (whichever is less)

-   Hit below 16, stand at 17+

-   They participate fully in the round, including betting and insurance logic.

### 🏆 Player Rankings

At the end of each round, an updated leader-board is displayed, showing every player’s current coin total. All rankings are refreshed automatically, so you can see how you stack up against friends or AI opponents without any manual steps.

### 📝 Bankroll History

During game-play, your coin balance is automatically tracked and visualized after each round. There’s no need to run any extra code—just play the game and watch your bankroll trends update in real time.

### 🔁 Play Again or Exit

At the end of each game, you’ll see:

> Type `again` to play another game, or `exit` to quit:

Simply type your choice at the prompt to continue playing or leave the game.

### 🧬 Function Hooks & Extensionsd

While `play()` and `simulate_blackjack()` provide complete game loops out-of-the-box, many internal components are modular and can be **replaced or extended by advanced users**.

Key functions you can customize:

| Function               | Purpose                                  | Called Automatically? |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|
| `player_action()`      | Player decision logic (hit/stand/double) | In `play()`           |
| `handle_insurance()`   | Insurance decision flow                  | In `play()`           |
| `handle_splitting()`   | Whether and how to split hands           | In `play()`           |
| `dealer_action()`      | Dealer behavior after all players acted  | In `play()`           |
| `player_action()`      | Your own strategy logic                  | In `play()`           |
| `play_player_turns()`  | Simulate a single player's turn          | Manually usable       |
| `calculate_score()`    | Compute score of any hand                | Manually usable       |
| `simulate_blackjack()` | Batch simulations with pluggable logic   | Manually usable       |

**Example:**

-   Custom Insurance Strategy

```{r eval=FALSE}
handle_insurance <- function(player_hand, dealer_card) {
  # Always decline insurance
  return(FALSE)
}

# Test insurance logic manually
handle_insurance(c("10♠", "9♦"), "A♠")
```

-   Redefine Player Decision Strategy

```{r eval=FALSE}
player_action <- function(hand, dealer_card, player_info) {
  # Always hit if score < 15
  if (calculate_score(hand)$score < 15) return("hit")
  else return("stand")
}

# Call the function in isolation
player_action(c("6♦", "8♣"), "K♠", list(coins = 1000))
```

-   Simulate a Single Turn

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create deck and simulate one turn manually
deck <- create_deck()
player_hand <- list(new_blackjack_hand(draw_cards(deck, 2)))
dealer_card <- draw_cards(deck, 1)

# Use your own player_action() inside this function
updated_hand <- play_player_turns(player_hand, deck, dealer_card)
```

## 🧠 Custom Strategy Simulation

Simulate thousands of Blackjack games to test your strategies automatically. You can control whether to split, buy insurance, or change your hit/stand threshold—just by passing simple options or your own functions.

### 🚦 Basic Example

Run a quick simulation with the default strategy (hit below 17, always buy insurance and always split pairs):

```{r,eval=FALSE}
simulation <- simulate_multiplayer_blackjack(num_rounds = 1000)
```

### ⚙️ Customize Your Strategy

You can easily change how the AI plays:

-   Adjust the hit/stand rule:Hit if below your chosen score, otherwise stand.

-   Choose to always/never split or buy insurance:Set split or buy_insurance to TRUE or FALSE.

-   Write your own decision logic:Pass a function to control split or insurance behavior.

Examples:

-   Never split, never buy insurance, hit below 18:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
simulation <- simulate_multiplayer_blackjack(
  num_players = 3,
  num_rounds = 100,
  threshold = 18,
  split = FALSE,
  buy_insurance = FALSE
)
```

-   Custom logic (split only A or 8, buy insurance only with blackjack):

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Split pairs of A or 8 only; buy insurance only when player's hand is blackjack.
simulation <- simulate_multiplayer_blackjack(
  num_rounds = 100,
  split = function(hand) {
    ranks <- card_rank(hand$cards)
    length(ranks) == 2 && ranks[1] == ranks[2] && ranks[1] %in% c("8", "A")
  },
  buy_insurance = function(player, dealer_hand) {
    is_blackjack(player$hand)
  }
)
```

### 🧑‍💻 Advanced: Custom Strategy Functions

You can pass any function to the `split` or `buy_insurance` argument in `simulate_multiplayer_blackjack()`, enabling sophisticated, context-dependent strategies. Additionally, vectors can also be passed to threshold, bet_amount, and initial_coins to customize each player's behavior.

1.  **Advanced logic: Each player has a different logic when deciding whether to split their cards or not.**

```{r,eval=FALSE}
split_basic <- function(hand) {
  # Split Aces and 8s only
  ranks <- card_rank(hand$cards)
  length(ranks) == 2 && ranks[1] == ranks[2] && ranks[1] %in% c("A", "8")
}

split_aggressive <- function(hand) {
  # Split everything except 10s and 5s
  ranks <- card_rank(hand$cards)
  if (length(ranks) != 2 || ranks[1] != ranks[2]) return(FALSE)
  !ranks[1] %in% c("10", "J", "Q", "K", "5")
}

split_never <- function(hand) {
  FALSE
}
```

2.  **Advanced insurance logic**

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Only buy insurance if player has blackjack AND dealer shows Ace.
insurance_dealer <- function(player, dealer_hand) {
  is_blackjack(player$hand) && card_rank(dealer_hand$cards[1]) == "A"
}

insurance_conservative <- function(player, dealer_hand) {
  # Only buy insurance if player has blackjack
  is_blackjack(player$hand)
}

insurance_aggressive <- function(player, dealer_hand) {
  # Always buy insurance when dealer shows Ace
  TRUE
}

insurance_smart <- function(player, dealer_hand) {
  # Buy insurance if player has 20 or blackjack
  player_score <- calculate_score(player$hand)
  player_score >= 20 || is_blackjack(player$hand)
}
```

3.  **Compare Strategies with Batch Simulation and Visualization**

```{r,eval=FALSE}
results <- simulate_multiplayer_blackjack(
  num_rounds = 1000,
  num_players = 4,
  threshold = c(17, 18, 16, 19),
  buy_insurance = list(insurance_conservative, insurance_aggressive, insurance_dealer, insurance_smart),
  split = list(split_basic, split_aggressive, split_never, FALSE),
  bet_amount = c(10, 15, 20, 25),
  initial_coins = c(1000, 1200, 800, 1500)
)
```

*These examples show how you can build, test, and visualize sophisticated blackjack strategies by passing custom logic into the simulation functions.*

### 📋 See Your Results
